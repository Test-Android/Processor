# Processor
Okay so eventually is going to be a kick ass game for android, and maybe ios if we ever get around to learning whatever language it uses.

# To Do List: 
We need to get all the collision things sorted, we need more images(the processor images). A title screen would be nice, perhaps even a pause screen. Saving data to phone, *pausing the thread???!!* (to save battery life obviously). Have only check to connect when you move your hand up. Buttons to buy active whenever. Selectability needs to be wayyyyy more obvious. Can click on whatever one you want when selectablility is on

# Quick Tips 
jake a # will bold the words following it, assuming it comes first in the line and words surrounded by *'s  will italicize it.
