# Processor
Okay so eventually is going to be a kick ass game for android, and maybe ios if we ever get around to learning whatever language it uses.

# To Do List: 
We need to get all the collision things sorted, we need more images(the processor images). A title screen would be nice, perhaps even a pause screen. Saving data to phone, *pausing the thread???!!* (to save battery life obviously)

also jake a # will bold the words following it, assuming it comes first in the line and words surrounded by *'s  will italicize it.
